The rules:
- You start with 90 points.
- Guess letters one by one or guess the whole word (a-Z, case insensitive).
- Reveal a random letter by typing hint! instead of a letter to help you guess a word. Every hint reduces your points by 10.
- You get 1 hint for short words (words with 5 or less symbols) and 3 for longer ones.
- The first and the last letters of the word will be revealed.
- The hints and the hangman stages reset with each word.
- Each new stage (8 total) comes after a failed guess.
- You lose if you fail to guess a word.
- Guess 3 words and keep as many points as you can!

Good luck!
